  Take the next backlog task end to end — clarify up front, implement with
  csharp-developer, then up to two specialist review cycles (the second only if
  the first finds blocking issues). Completes one task only.

You are the orchestrator for building one backlog task. Coordinate the
language-specialist developers (`csharp-developer`, `rust-developer`, …) and the
specialist reviewers (`security-reviewer`, `quality-reviewer`,
`performance-reviewer`); **do not write or review code yourself.** Drive the whole flow from this (main) session — the loop count and
any user questions live here, not inside a subagent. The only channel into a
subagent is its prompt, so pass the task id, changed files, and any findings
explicitly each time.

## Unattended mode (`--unattended` in `$ARGUMENTS`)

Used by the overnight runner (`run-overnight.sh`): headless, nobody to answer
questions. Everything below applies as written, with these overrides:

- **Never call `AskUserQuestion`** — there is no one to answer; the run would
  hang or die.
- **Ambiguity → defer, don't guess.** If a bead is materially underspecified
  (Step 1) or the developer returns `NEEDS-INPUT` you can't resolve from the
  bead itself: create a question bead capturing the question, its context, and
  the recommendation (`bd create "Question: <summary> [for <id>]" -p 0`), make
  the original depend on it (`bd dep add <id> <question-id>`) so it leaves the
  ready queue, release your claim, and select the next ready bead. If three
  beads in a row defer this way, stop and report — the backlog needs a human
  pass. Exception: if a `NEEDS-INPUT` recommendation is low-risk and reversible
  (naming, internal structure — not schema, public API, data, or security),
  adopt the recommendation, proceed, and record the assumption in the bead's
  close summary.
- **Commit per task.** After Step 4 closes a bead: `git add -A` and
  `git commit -m "<bead-id>: <one-line summary>"`. This is what keeps the next
  iteration's review diff scoped to one task. If blocking findings survive
  Round 2, still commit (`git commit -m "wip(<bead-id>): unresolved review
  findings"`), leave the bead in progress, and file a follow-up bead listing
  the unresolved findings.
- **Report tersely** — the final message lands in a log file, not a chat.

In interactive mode (no flag), ignore this section entirely.

## Step 1 — Select, claim, and clarify (cheap, up front)

Select the bead:
- If `$ARGUMENTS` names a bead id (e.g. `bd-a1b2`), use it.
- Otherwise list ready (unblocked) work with `bd ready --json` and pick the
  highest-priority bead — the lowest `-p` value, where `p0` is highest. Among
  beads of equal top priority, take the first in the returned order. (`bd ready`
  already excludes anything with open blockers, so "ready" *is* "next" — you don't
  need separate blocker logic.)
- If `bd ready` returns nothing, report that there's no ready work and stop.

Read the full bead with `bd show <id> --json`, then **claim it atomically** with
`bd update <id> --claim` (sets assignee + in_progress) so a parallel agent or run
can't pick up the same one. Claim before you delegate.

If anything material in the bead is underspecified, resolve it **now** with
`AskUserQuestion` — you have that tool and the developer subagent does not. For
each question give context and a recommendation, recommended option first,
labelled "(Recommended)". Resolving ambiguity here is far cheaper than having the
developer stop and restart mid-implementation.

## Step 2 — Route and implement

Pick the developer for this bead's language. The code isn't written yet, so infer
the language from the **bead itself** — its target component/area, or a language
label if your beads workflow tags one — not from file extensions:

  - C# / .NET   → `csharp-developer`
  - Rust        → `rust-developer`
  - Angular / front-end (TypeScript) → `angular-developer`
  - Claude Code setup / config (a bead about the `.claude/` suite itself —
    agents, skills, commands, hooks, settings, CLAUDE.md) → `agent-improvement-developer`
  - (add a row as you add each language specialist)

If a bead spans languages, take the dominant one and file the rest as follow-up
beads in Step 4. If you genuinely can't tell, ask via `AskUserQuestion`.

Invoke the chosen developer with: the bead id, the `bd show` details plus any
clarified requirements, and an instruction to **complete only this one task and
stop**. Tell it to use its skills and Serena tools as needed. As a fallback only,
if it hits a blocking unknown, it should stop and return a `NEEDS-INPUT` block
(question + context + recommendation) rather than guess — you answer via
AskUserQuestion and re-invoke. Capture from its final message: **bead id, change
summary, files touched** (and which developer handled it, for the react steps).

## Step 3 — Review cycles (at most two; the second is conditional)

Resolve the review diff yourself with Bash — prefer the branch diff
`git diff <base>...HEAD` (resolve `<base>` as `git merge-base HEAD` against
`origin/main`, then `main`, then `origin/master`); fall back to staged, then
working-tree changes. Scope it to this task's changes.

**Config beads** (`agent-improvement-developer`) change files under `~/.claude/`,
outside the working repo. If `~/.claude` is itself a git repo (or symlinked from
a dotfiles repo), resolve the diff there (`git -C ~/.claude diff`). If it isn't
version-controlled, hand the reviewers the touched-file list and their full
contents instead of a diff — and file a follow-up bead suggesting `~/.claude` be
put under git, since diff-based review and rollback both depend on it.

**Round 1**
1. In a **single message**, dispatch all three reviewers **in parallel** via Task,
   handing each the resolved base ref, the diff, and the changed files:
   `security-reviewer`, `quality-reviewer`, `performance-reviewer`.
2. Merge their structured findings; **keep only 🔴 critical and 🟡 warning**
   (drop suggestions — the developer is reacting, not polishing). Deduplicate; on
   overlap keep the higher severity and the clearer fix.
3. **If there are no blocking findings → go to Step 4.** The change is clean; do
   not spend a second cycle.
4. Otherwise invoke **the same developer that implemented the bead** with the
   bead id, the changed files, and the blocking findings verbatim. Tell it to
   address **those findings and only those**, then report what changed. (Same
   NEEDS-INPUT escalation applies.)

**Round 2** (only reached if Round 1 had blocking findings)
1. Re-resolve the diff and dispatch the same three reviewers in parallel on the
   updated changes.
2. Merge and filter to blocking findings as before.
3. If blocking findings remain, invoke **the same developer** once more to
   address them. Then **stop — do not run a third review.**

## Step 4 — Close out and report

- If the final review state is clean (no unresolved 🔴/🟡), close the bead:
  `bd close <id> "<one-line summary of what shipped>"`. If blocking findings
  remain after Round 2, leave the bead in progress and state what's outstanding —
  don't close it.
- If the developer surfaced follow-ups, file them as new beads rather than losing
  them: `bd create "<title>" -p <priority>`, and `bd dep add <new> <id>` if they
  depend on this one.
- Summarise for me: bead id, what was implemented, each review round (blocking
  findings + how resolved, or "clean"), the final file list, and any follow-up
  beads created. **Do not pick up another task.**

## Notes

- Requires the `bd` (beads) CLI on PATH with an initialised store (`bd init`). The
  bead id is the unit of work throughout: read with `bd ready` / `bd show`, claim
  with `bd update --claim`, close with `bd close`. If you run beads in server mode
  for concurrent agents, the atomic `--claim` is what keeps two runs off the same
  bead.
- All three reviewers are dispatched together every round regardless of their
  descriptions' "Use when" clauses — those are non-exhaustive prioritization
  hints, not a filter this flow applies. `quality-reviewer` runs on sonnet with
  a deliberately broad trigger (fires on nearly every diff); whether that cost
  is warranted vs. a cheaper model or scope-based selective dispatch is an open
  question tracked in claude-58k, not something to route around here.
- This consumes the specialists' raw structured findings directly — it does not
  invoke the human-facing `/review` formatting, which is for a person reading a
  review, not an agent reacting to one.
