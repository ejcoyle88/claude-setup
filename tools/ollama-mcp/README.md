# ollama-mcp

A small stdio [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that talks to a
local [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) instance, so Claude Code can offload work
to it instead of spending API tokens.

This is a **scaffold** (bead `claude-r30.3`): it proves the transport works and
can check whether Ollama is reachable. It does not yet expose any real offload
tools. A later bead (`claude-r30.4`) adds reference-based tools
(`summarize_file`, `extract`, `classify`) that take file paths/globs as input
so bulk text never enters Claude's context.

## Tools

- **`ping`** — takes no arguments, returns a static `{ ok: true }`. Proves the
  MCP stdio transport is working; does not contact Ollama.
- **`health`** — takes no arguments, does a lightweight `GET /api/tags`
  against `OLLAMA_HOST`. Never throws: returns
  `{ reachable, host, model, error? }`, degrading gracefully when Ollama is
  down or not yet deployed.

## Environment variables

| Variable       | Default                 | Purpose                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `OLLAMA_HOST`  | `http://ollama:11434`    | Base URL of the Ollama server (no path).   |
| `OLLAMA_MODEL` | `llama3.2`               | Default model for future offload tools.    |

The `ollama` hostname above resolves to the Ollama sidecar container added by
a separate bead (`claude-r30.1`). That sidecar is not required for this server
to start — `ping` and `health` both work (with `health` reporting
`reachable: false`) even when Ollama isn't running yet.

## Build and run

```bash
cd tools/ollama-mcp
npm install
npm run build     # compiles src/ -> dist/ via tsc
npm start          # runs dist/index.js over stdio
```

For local development without a full reinstall loop, `npx tsc --noEmit` type-checks
without emitting.

## Register with Claude Code

Project scope (shared via `.mcp.json`, checked into the repo):

```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio ollama-mcp --scope project \
  --env OLLAMA_HOST=http://ollama:11434 --env OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.2 \
  -- node tools/ollama-mcp/dist/index.js
```

Or by hand in `.mcp.json` at the repo root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ollama-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["tools/ollama-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "OLLAMA_HOST": "http://ollama:11434",
        "OLLAMA_MODEL": "llama3.2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Run `npm install && npm run build` in `tools/ollama-mcp/` first so
`dist/index.js` exists — Claude Code spawns the compiled server directly, it
does not build it for you.

After registering, run `/mcp` inside Claude Code to confirm `ollama-mcp` is
connected, then try the `ping` and `health` tools.
